# Bulk Purchase Order Draft Creation - Implementation Summary
**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Feature:** Create Purchase Order Drafts from Low Stock Suppliers Page

## üìã Overview

Successfully implemented a new feature that allows users to automatically create Purchase Order drafts directly from the "Low Stock Products" page, eliminating the need to manually create purchase orders for each supplier.

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes

#### New Endpoint: `/api/v1/purchase-orders/bulk-create-drafts`
**File:** `app/api/v1/endpoints/purchase_orders.py`

**Features:**
- Accepts selected products with supplier information
- Automatically groups products by supplier name
- Creates or finds existing suppliers in the database
- Generates one draft Purchase Order per supplier
- Returns detailed results including created orders and any errors
- Handles edge cases (missing products, invalid quantities, etc.)

**Key Functionality:**
```python
@router.post("/bulk-create-drafts", response_model=dict[str, Any])
async def bulk_create_purchase_order_drafts(
    bulk_data: dict[str, Any],
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db),
    current_user=Depends(get_current_user),
):
    """
    Create multiple purchase order drafts from low stock supplier selections.
    Groups products by supplier and creates one draft PO per supplier.
    """
```

**Supplier Auto-Creation:**
- If a supplier doesn't exist in the database, it's automatically created
- Generates unique supplier codes (e.g., `SUP-SUPPLIERNAME-1`)
- Sets default values (lead time: 7 days, status: active)

**Purchase Order Details:**
- Status: `draft` (can be reviewed before sending)
- Uses product `base_price` as unit cost
- Includes auto-generated notes with product count
- Groups all products from the same supplier into one PO

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### Updated Component: `LowStockSuppliers.tsx`
**File:** `admin-frontend/src/pages/products/LowStockSuppliers.tsx`

**New Features:**
1. **"Create Draft POs" Button**
   - Located next to the "Export Excel" button
   - Shows count of selected products
   - Styled in green to indicate creation action
   - Disabled when no products are selected
   - Shows loading state during creation

2. **Confirmation Modal**
   - Displays summary before creating drafts
   - Shows number of products and suppliers
   - Explains that drafts can be reviewed later
   - Provides clear "Create Drafts" / "Cancel" options

3. **Success Notification**
   - Shows detailed results for each created order
   - Displays order number, supplier name, product count
   - Lists any errors that occurred
   - Provides link to Purchase Orders page
   - Auto-clears selections after successful creation

4. **Error Handling**
   - Catches and displays API errors
   - Shows user-friendly error messages
   - Maintains selections on error for retry

#### Updated API Client: `purchaseOrders.ts`
**File:** `admin-frontend/src/api/purchaseOrders.ts`

**New Function:**
```typescript
bulkCreateDrafts: async (selectedProducts: Array<{
  product_id: number;
  sku: string;
  supplier_id: string;
  supplier_name: string;
  reorder_quantity: number;
}>) => {
  // Calls the backend endpoint
  // Returns created orders and errors
}
```

### 3. User Interface Updates

**Updated Instructions Section:**
- Added step 5: "Create Draft POs" with icon
- Added step 6: "Export Excel" (renumbered)
- Added tip about draft PO status
- Clarified Excel export functionality

**Button Layout:**
```
[Sync eMAG FBE] [Refresh] [Create Draft POs (N)] [Export Excel (N)]
```

## üéØ User Workflow

### Before (Manual Process):
1. Select suppliers on Low Stock page
2. Export to Excel
3. Go to Purchase Orders page
4. Click "New Purchase Order"
5. Manually select supplier
6. Manually add each product
7. Manually enter quantities
8. Repeat for each supplier

### After (Automated Process):
1. Select suppliers on Low Stock page
2. Click "Create Draft POs"
3. Confirm in modal
4. ‚úÖ Done! All drafts created automatically
5. (Optional) Go to Purchase Orders to review/edit
6. (Optional) Export Excel for supplier communication

## üìä Benefits

1. **Time Savings:** Reduces PO creation from minutes per supplier to seconds for all
2. **Error Reduction:** Eliminates manual data entry errors
3. **Efficiency:** Batch creation instead of one-by-one
4. **Flexibility:** Drafts can be reviewed and edited before sending
5. **Automation:** Suppliers are auto-created if they don't exist
6. **Traceability:** Auto-generated notes indicate source

## üîß Technical Details

### Backend Architecture
- **Endpoint:** POST `/api/v1/purchase-orders/bulk-create-drafts`
- **Authentication:** Requires JWT token (current user)
- **Database:** Uses async SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL
- **Transaction:** All-or-nothing per supplier (rollback on error)
- **Service Layer:** Uses existing `PurchaseOrderService`

### Data Flow
```
Frontend Selection
    ‚Üì
API Call (bulkCreateDrafts)
    ‚Üì
Backend Endpoint (bulk-create-drafts)
    ‚Üì
Group by Supplier
    ‚Üì
For Each Supplier:
  - Find/Create Supplier
  - Prepare Order Lines
  - Create Draft PO
    ‚Üì
Return Results
    ‚Üì
Frontend Notification
```

### Error Handling
- **Backend:** Try-catch per supplier, continues on individual failures
- **Frontend:** Displays all errors in notification
- **Database:** Transaction rollback on critical errors
- **Validation:** Checks for valid products, quantities, suppliers

## üìù Files Modified

### Backend (Python)
1. `app/api/v1/endpoints/purchase_orders.py` - Added bulk-create-drafts endpoint

### Frontend (TypeScript/React)
1. `admin-frontend/src/api/purchaseOrders.ts` - Added bulkCreateDrafts function
2. `admin-frontend/src/pages/products/LowStockSuppliers.tsx` - Added button and handler

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. **Basic Flow:**
   - Navigate to Low Stock Products page
   - Select suppliers for multiple products
   - Click "Create Draft POs"
   - Verify confirmation modal shows correct counts
   - Confirm creation
   - Check success notification
   - Navigate to Purchase Orders page
   - Verify drafts were created correctly

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - Create drafts with single product
   - Create drafts with multiple suppliers
   - Create drafts with same supplier multiple times
   - Test with non-existent supplier (should auto-create)
   - Test with existing supplier (should reuse)
   - Test with invalid product IDs
   - Test with zero quantities

3. **Error Scenarios:**
   - Test without authentication
   - Test with empty selection
   - Test with database connection issues
   - Test with invalid supplier names

### Automated Testing (Future):
- Unit tests for backend endpoint
- Integration tests for supplier creation
- E2E tests for full workflow
- API contract tests

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Pre-existing Issues (Not Related to This Feature):
1. **Notification Service Error:** DateTime timezone mismatch in notifications
   - Error: "can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes"
   - Impact: None on PO functionality
   - Status: Pre-existing, needs separate fix

### Current Limitations:
1. **Unit Cost:** Uses product `base_price`, may need manual adjustment
2. **Currency:** Defaults to RON, may need adjustment for international suppliers
3. **Supplier Matching:** Matches by name (case-insensitive), could have duplicates if names vary slightly
4. **No Undo:** Once created, drafts must be manually deleted if incorrect

### Future Enhancements:
1. Add supplier price lookup from ProductSupplierSheet
2. Support multiple currencies with exchange rates
3. Add supplier deduplication/merging tool
4. Add "Undo" or "Delete All Drafts" option
5. Add email notification to suppliers
6. Add PDF generation for POs
7. Add approval workflow for drafts

## üìö Documentation Updates Needed

1. **User Guide:** Add section on bulk draft creation
2. **API Documentation:** Document new endpoint in OpenAPI/Swagger
3. **Training Materials:** Update screenshots and workflows
4. **Release Notes:** Include in next release notes
