**Date**: September 30, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**  
**API Version**: eMAG Marketplace API v4.4.9

---

## üìã Executive Summary

Successfully implemented all new features from eMAG API v4.4.9 in the MagFlow ERP system, including:
- ‚úÖ **Addresses Management API** (NEW in v4.4.9)
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced AWB Creation** with `address_id` support (NEW in v4.4.9)
- ‚úÖ **Frontend Dashboard** for address management
- ‚úÖ **Complete API Integration** with all v4.4.9 endpoints

---

## üéØ What's New in v4.4.9

### 1. Addresses API (NEW) ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**Purpose**: Manage saved pickup and return addresses for AWB creation.

**Backend Implementation**:
- **File**: `/app/services/emag_api_client.py`
- **Method**: `get_addresses(page, items_per_page)`
- **Endpoint**: `POST /addresses/read`

**API Endpoints Created**:
- `GET /api/v1/emag/addresses/list` - Get all addresses
- `GET /api/v1/emag/addresses/pickup` - Get only pickup addresses (type 2)
- `GET /api/v1/emag/addresses/return` - Get only return addresses (type 1)
- `POST /api/v1/emag/addresses/awb/create` - Create AWB with address_id support

**Frontend Implementation**:
- **File**: `/admin-frontend/src/pages/EmagAddresses.tsx`
- **Route**: `/emag/addresses`
- **Features**:
  - View all saved addresses for MAIN and FBE accounts
  - Filter by address type (Pickup, Return, Invoice HQ, Delivery Estimates)
  - Statistics dashboard with address counts
  - Expandable rows with detailed address information
  - Real-time refresh capability

**Address Types Supported**:
- **Type 1**: Return addresses (for RMA AWBs)
- **Type 2**: Pickup addresses (for order AWBs)
- **Type 3**: Invoice (HQ) addresses
- **Type 4**: Delivery estimates addresses

---

### 2. Enhanced AWB Creation with address_id ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**Purpose**: Simplify AWB creation by using saved address IDs instead of providing full address details.

**Backend Implementation**:
- **File**: `/app/services/emag_api_client.py`
- **Method**: `create_awb()` - Updated with address_id support
- **New Parameters**:
  - `sender.address_id` - Use saved sender address
  - `receiver.address_id` - Use saved receiver address

**Behavior**:
- When `address_id` is provided, the saved address is used regardless of other address fields
- Simplifies AWB creation workflow
- Ensures consistency across shipments

**Example Usage**:
```python
# Create AWB for order with saved pickup address
await client.create_awb(
    order_id=123456,
    sender={'address_id': '12345', 'name': 'My Company', 
            'contact': 'John Doe', 'phone1': '0721234567'},
    receiver={'name': 'Customer', 'contact': 'Customer',
             'phone1': '0729876543', 'locality_id': 8801,
             'street': 'Str. Customer, Nr. 5', 'legal_entity': 0},
    parcel_number=1,
    cod=199.99
)
```

**Measurements API** (`measurements/save`):
- Save product dimensions and weight
- Units: millimeters (mm) for dimensions, grams (g) for weight

**Campaign Management**:
- Propose products to eMAG campaigns
- Support for MultiDeals campaigns with date intervals
- Voucher discount management

**Smart Deals Badge**:
