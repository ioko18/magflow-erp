# Quick Fix Guide - Supplier Verification Issue

## Problem
After confirming a supplier match (YUJIA for SKU=EMG411) in "Produse Furnizori", the verified supplier was not showing in "Low Stock Products - Supplier Selection" page.

## Solution Applied

### Root Cause
The frontend had showOnlyVerified = true by default, hiding all unverified suppliers.

### What Was Fixed

1. Changed default filter to OFF - Now shows ALL suppliers by default
2. Added clear verification badges - Green "Verified" or Orange "Pending Verification"
3. Enhanced filter visibility - The checkbox now has a border and background when active
4. Added helpful guidance - When no verified suppliers found, shows instructions
5. Created debug endpoint - /api/v1/debug/supplier-verification/{sku} for troubleshooting

## How to Use Now

### Step 1: Verify a Supplier Match
1. Go to "Produse Furnizori" page
2. Select supplier (e.g., YUJIA)
3. Find the product (e.g., SKU=EMG411)
4. Click "Confirma Match" button
5. Wait for success message

### Step 2: Check in Low Stock Products
1. Go to "Low Stock Products - Supplier Selection" page
2. Click "Refresh" button (top right)
3. Find your product (SKU=EMG411)
4. Click "Select Supplier" to expand
5. You should now see YUJIA with a green "Verified" tag

### Step 3: Use the Filter (Optional)
- The "Show Only Verified Suppliers" checkbox is now OFF by default
- Turn it ON to see only verified suppliers
- Turn it OFF to see all suppliers (verified and unverified)

## Debugging

If a verified supplier still does not show:

### Option 1: Use the Debug Endpoint
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/v1/debug/supplier-verification/EMG411
```

### Option 2: Check the Filter
- Make sure "Show Only Verified Suppliers" is OFF
- Click "Refresh" button
- Check if the supplier appears now

### Option 3: Verify the Match
- Go back to "Produse Furnizori"
- Check if the match shows as "Confirmat" (green tag)
- If not, click "Confirma Match" again

## Visual Indicators

### Supplier Verification Status
- Verified (Green) = Manually confirmed match
- Pending Verification (Orange) = Match exists but not confirmed

### Filter Status
- Green border + background = Filter is ON (showing only verified)
- Gray border = Filter is OFF (showing all suppliers)
