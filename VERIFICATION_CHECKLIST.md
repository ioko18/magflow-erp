## üîÑ Post-Deployment Testing (To Be Done)

### 1. Product Sync Testing

#### Test Case 1: Normal Product Sync
```bash
# Trigger product sync
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/emag/products/sync \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "account": "both",
    "mode": "full",
    "async": true
  }'
```

**Expected Results:**
- Sync completes successfully
- All pages processed (or skipped with clear logging)
- Statistics show correct counts
- No unhandled exceptions

#### Test Case 2: Timeout Handling
**Scenario:** API returns 504 on specific pages

**Expected Behavior:**
- Page is retried up to 5 times with exponential backoff
- After 5 failures, page is skipped
- Sync continues to next page
- Error logged in sync_stats["errors"]
- Final statistics show partial success

**Log Verification:**
```
‚úÖ "Retry 1/5 for main page X after 2s (status: 504)"
‚úÖ "Retry 2/5 for main page X after 4s (status: 504)"
‚úÖ "Retry 3/5 for main page X after 8s (status: 504)"
‚úÖ "Retry 4/5 for main page X after 16s (status: 504)"
‚úÖ "Retry 5/5 for main page X after 30s (status: 504)"
‚úÖ "Failed to fetch main page X after 5 attempts (status: 504). Skipping this page."
‚úÖ "Skipped page X for main after retries (1/3 pages skipped)"
‚úÖ "Fetching page X+1 for main account"
```

#### Test Case 3: Multiple Page Failures
**Scenario:** Multiple consecutive pages fail

**Expected Behavior:**
- First 3 pages can be skipped
- After 3 skipped pages, sync stops for that account
- Other account (if both) continues normally
- Clear error message logged

**Log Verification:**
```
‚úÖ "Skipped page X for main after retries (1/3 pages skipped)"
‚úÖ "Skipped page Y for main after retries (2/3 pages skipped)"
‚úÖ "Skipped page Z for main after retries (3/3 pages skipped)"
‚úÖ "Too many skipped pages (3), stopping sync for main"
```

### 2. Order Sync Testing

#### Test Case 1: Normal Order Sync
**Trigger:** Wait for scheduled task or trigger manually

**Expected Results:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T...",
  "accounts": {
    "main": {
      "success": true,
      "orders_synced": 5,
      "new_orders": 3,
      "updated_orders": 2
    },
    "fbe": {
      "success": true,
      "orders_synced": 2,
      "new_orders": 1,
      "updated_orders": 1
    }
  },
  "total_orders_synced": 7,
  "total_new_orders": 4,
  "errors": []
}
```

**Verification:**
- [x] `orders_synced` = `new_orders` + `updated_orders` ‚úÖ
- [x] `total_orders_synced` = sum of all accounts ‚úÖ
- [x] `total_new_orders` = sum of new orders ‚úÖ
- [x] Statistics match actual database changes ‚úÖ

#### Test Case 2: Order Sync with Errors
**Scenario:** One account fails

**Expected Results:**
```json
{
  "accounts": {
    "main": {
      "success": false,
      "error": "Connection timeout"
    },
    "fbe": {
      "success": true,
      "orders_synced": 2,
      "new_orders": 1,
      "updated_orders": 1
    }
  },
  "errors": ["main: Connection timeout"]
}
```

### 3. Error Recovery Testing

#### Test Case 1: Transient Network Issues
**Scenario:** Network drops during sync

**Expected Behavior:**
- Retry logic activates
- Exponential backoff applied
- Sync recovers automatically
- No data corruption

#### Test Case 2: API Rate Limiting
**Scenario:** Hit rate limit during sync

**Expected Behavior:**
- 429 errors trigger retry
- Appropriate wait time applied
- Sync continues after rate limit window
- All data eventually synced

#### Test Case 3: Partial Page Failures
**Scenario:** Some products in a page fail to save

**Expected Behavior:**
- Failed products logged individually
- Other products in batch still saved
- Sync continues to next page
- Failed count tracked in statistics

### 4. Monitoring and Alerting

#### Metrics to Monitor
- [ ] Sync success rate (should be >95%)
- [ ] Average sync duration
- [ ] Number of retries per sync
- [ ] Number of skipped pages per sync
- [ ] Error rate by type (timeout, connection, etc.)

#### Alert Thresholds
- [ ] More than 3 skipped pages in single sync
- [ ] Sync duration exceeds 15 minutes
- [ ] Error rate exceeds 5%
- [ ] Multiple consecutive sync failures

### 5. Database Verification

#### Check Data Integrity
```sql
-- Verify product counts
SELECT account_type, COUNT(*) as product_count
FROM emag_products_v2
GROUP BY account_type;

-- Verify order counts
SELECT account_type, status_name, COUNT(*) as order_count
FROM emag_orders
GROUP BY account_type, status_name;

-- Check for orphaned records
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM emag_products_v2 WHERE sku IS NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM emag_orders WHERE emag_order_id IS NULL;

-- Verify sync logs
SELECT * FROM emag_sync_logs
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 6. Performance Testing

#### Load Test
- [ ] Run sync with maximum pages
- [ ] Monitor memory usage
- [ ] Check CPU utilization
- [ ] Verify no memory leaks
- [ ] Confirm connection pool management

#### Stress Test
- [ ] Simulate multiple concurrent syncs
- [ ] Test with large product catalogs (>10k products)
- [ ] Verify rate limiting works correctly
- [ ] Check database connection handling

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Max Skipped Pages:** Set to 3 - may need adjustment based on real-world data
2. **Timeout Duration:** 90s per request - may need tuning for large responses
3. **Retry Strategy:** Exponential backoff maxes at 30s - consider making configurable

### Future Improvements
1. **Adaptive Retry:** Adjust retry count based on error type
2. **Partial Page Retry:** Retry individual products instead of entire page
3. **Resume Capability:** Save progress and resume from last successful page
4. **Parallel Sync:** Process multiple accounts concurrently
5. **Smart Scheduling:** Adjust sync frequency based on error rates

## üîç Debugging Guide

### If Product Sync Fails

1. **Check Logs:**
   ```bash
   docker logs magflow_app | grep "product_sync"
   docker logs magflow_app | grep "ERROR"
   ```

2. **Check Sync Stats:**
   - Look for `sync_stats["errors"]` in logs
   - Check `skipped_pages` counter
   - Verify retry attempts

3. **Verify API Connectivity:**
   ```bash
   curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD https://marketplace-api.emag.ro/api-3/product_offer/read
   ```

4. **Check Database:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM emag_sync_logs WHERE status = 'failed' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```

### If Order Sync Shows Wrong Stats

1. **Verify Service Response:**
   - Check that service returns `synced`, `created`, `updated` keys
   - Verify task uses correct keys

2. **Check Database:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM emag_orders WHERE last_synced_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
   ```

3. **Compare Logs:**
   - Service logs should show actual counts
   - Task logs should match service counts

## üìù Rollback Plan

If issues arise after deployment:

1. **Immediate Rollback:**
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   docker compose down
   docker compose up -d
   ```

2. **Verify Rollback:**
   - Check that old code is running
   - Verify sync still works (with old behavior)
   - Monitor for any new issues

3. **Investigation:**
   - Collect logs from failed deployment
   - Analyze error patterns
   - Identify root cause
   - Plan fix for next deployment
