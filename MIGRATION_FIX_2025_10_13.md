# Migration Fix - October 13, 2025

## Problem
The application was failing to start with the error:
```
asyncpg.exceptions.DuplicateTableError: relation "users" already exists
```

## Root Cause
The database tables were already created by the `init-db` scripts, but Alembic's migration system thought no migrations had been run yet. When Alembic tried to run the initial migration `86f7456767fd`, it attempted to create tables that already existed, causing the error.

## Solution
Made all Alembic migrations **idempotent** by adding checks to verify if tables/columns exist before attempting to create them. This ensures migrations can be safely run multiple times without errors.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/alembic/versions/86f7456767fd_initial_database_schema_with_users_.py`
- Added table existence checks using SQLAlchemy inspector
- Only creates tables if they don't already exist
- Tables checked: `users`, `roles`, `permissions`, `user_roles`, `role_permissions`, `refresh_tokens`

### 2. `/alembic/versions/4242d9721c62_add_missing_tables.py`
- Added table existence check for `audit_logs`
- Only creates table and indexes if table doesn't exist

### 3. `/alembic/versions/97aa49837ac6_add_product_relationships_tables.py`
- Added table existence checks for `product_variants` and `product_genealogy`
- Only creates tables and their indexes if they don't exist

### 4. `/alembic/versions/6d303f2068d4_create_emag_offer_tables.py`
- Added table existence checks for:
  - `emag_products`
  - `emag_product_offers`
  - `emag_offer_syncs`
  - `emag_import_conflicts`
- Only creates tables and indexes if they don't exist

### 5. `/alembic/versions/20251013_fix_import_logs_timezone.py`
- Added column type checks before altering columns
- Only converts columns from `TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE` to `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` if needed
- Columns: `import_logs.started_at`, `import_logs.completed_at`, `product_mappings.last_imported_at`

### 6. `/alembic/versions/20251013_fix_product_supplier_sheets_tz.py`
- Added column type checks before altering columns
- Uses parameterized queries to avoid SQL injection warnings
- Columns: `price_updated_at`, `last_imported_at`, `verified_at`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

## Migration Already Idempotent
- `/alembic/versions/b1234f5d6c78_add_metadata_column_to_emag_product_offers.py` - Already had proper checks

## Additional Fixes Applied

### 7. Fixed Multiple SQL Statements Issue
The asyncpg driver doesn't support multiple SQL statements in a single `op.execute()` call. Split the seed data INSERT statements into separate calls:
- Separated role insertion from permissions insertion
- Each INSERT is now executed independently

### 8. Fixed NOT NULL Constraint Violation
The seed data INSERT statements were missing required `created_at` and `updated_at` columns:
- Added `created_at` and `updated_at` columns to INSERT statements
- Used `now()` function to populate timestamp values

### 9. Fixed Duplicate ENUM Type Error
The `init_database_complete.py` script was trying to create ENUM types that already existed:
- Added comprehensive check to verify if database schema is already initialized
- Checks both for existing tables (`users`) and ENUM types (`cancellationstatus`)
- If either tables or ENUMs exist, skip table creation to avoid duplicate errors
- File: `/scripts/init_database_complete.py`
- Query checks: `information_schema.tables` and `pg_type` catalog

## Testing Results
âœ… **All containers are now running successfully!**

After applying all fixes:
1. âœ… Migrations run successfully even if tables already exist
2. âœ… Tables that already exist are skipped
3. âœ… Only new changes are applied
4. âœ… Application starts without errors
5. âœ… Health check endpoint returns: `{"status": "alive"}`

### Container Status
```
NAME             STATUS
magflow_app      Up (healthy)
magflow_worker   Up (healthy)
magflow_db       Up (healthy)
magflow_redis    Up (healthy)
```

### Application Logs
```
âœ… Database already initialized
ðŸ”„ Running database migrations...
âœ… Migrations completed successfully!
ðŸŽ‰ Application ready to start!
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
INFO: Application startup complete
```

## Summary
The migration errors have been completely resolved. The application now:
- Handles existing database tables gracefully
- Runs migrations idempotently
- Starts successfully with all services healthy
- Responds to health check requests
