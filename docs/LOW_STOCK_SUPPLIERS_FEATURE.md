# Low Stock Products with Supplier Selection - Feature Documentation

## üìã Overview

This feature allows you to view products with low stock levels, see all available suppliers for each product with their prices, manually select preferred suppliers, and export the data to Excel files grouped by supplier.

## üéØ Use Case

Based on your screenshot showing a spreadsheet with products and supplier information, this feature automates the process of:
1. Identifying products with low stock
2. Viewing all available suppliers and their prices for each product
3. Manually selecting the best supplier for each product
4. Exporting selected products grouped by supplier for easy ordering

## üìä Data Sources

### 1. Google Sheets Suppliers (`ProductSupplierSheet`)
- Imported from Google Sheets "Product_Suppliers" tab
- Contains manually curated supplier data
- Prices in CNY
- Can include supplier contact info and product specifications

### 2. 1688.com Suppliers (`SupplierProduct`)
- Scraped from 1688.com marketplace
- Linked to `Supplier` model with full supplier profiles
- Includes product URLs and Chinese names
- Tracks price history

## üîß Configuration

### Database Models Used
1. **`InventoryItem`** - Stock levels and reorder points
2. **`Product`** - Product information and SKUs
3. **`Warehouse`** - Warehouse information
4. **`ProductSupplierSheet`** - Google Sheets supplier data
5. **`SupplierProduct`** - 1688.com supplier mappings
6. **`Supplier`** - Supplier profiles

### Stock Status Calculation
```python
def calculate_stock_status(item: InventoryItem) -> str:
    available = item.quantity - item.reserved_quantity
    
    if available <= 0:
        return "out_of_stock"
    elif available <= item.minimum_stock:
        return "critical"
    elif available <= item.reorder_point:
        return "low_stock"
    else:
        return "in_stock"
```

### Reorder Quantity Calculation
```python
def calculate_reorder_quantity(item: InventoryItem) -> int:
    available = item.quantity - item.reserved_quantity
    
    if item.maximum_stock:
        return max(0, item.maximum_stock - available)
    elif item.reorder_point > 0:
        return max(0, (item.reorder_point * 2) - available)
    else:
        return max(0, (item.minimum_stock * 3) - available)
```

## üìù Example Workflow

### Scenario: Ordering from Multiple Suppliers

1. **Morning Review:**
   - Open Low Stock Suppliers page
   - See 25 products need reordering
   - 15 have suppliers, 10 need supplier setup

     - Supplier 2: 24.50 CNY
     - Supplier 3: 21.00 CNY (new, not verified)
   - Select Supplier 1 (preferred despite not cheapest)
   
   - Product B (ESP32): 2 suppliers available
     - Supplier 1: 11.50 CNY
     - Supplier 4: 10.80 CNY (better price)
   - Select Supplier 4

3. **Export:**
   - Click "Export Selected (15)"
   - Excel file downloads: `low_stock_by_supplier_20251010_195000.xlsx`
   - File contains:
     - **Sheet "Supplier 1"**: 8 products, Total: 1,245.60 CNY
     - **Sheet "Supplier 4"**: 5 products, Total: 892.30 CNY

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: No suppliers showing for products**
- **Cause:** Products not linked to suppliers in database
- **Solution:** Import supplier data via Google Sheets or add 1688.com mappings

**Issue: Excel export fails**
- **Cause:** `openpyxl` not installed
- **Solution:** Run `pip install openpyxl` in backend environment

**Issue: Prices not showing in RON**
- **Cause:** Exchange rate not set in `ProductSupplierSheet`
- **Solution:** Update `calculated_price_ron` field or add exchange rate calculation

**Issue: Products not appearing in low stock list**
- **Cause:** `minimum_stock` or `reorder_point` not set
- **Solution:** Update inventory settings for products

## üéì Technical Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Query uses `selectinload` for efficient supplier loading
- Pagination prevents large result sets
- Consider adding caching for frequently accessed data

### Database Queries
- Main query joins: `InventoryItem` ‚Üí `Product` ‚Üí `Warehouse`
- Supplier queries: Separate queries for `ProductSupplierSheet` and `SupplierProduct`
- Uses `in_` clause for efficient bulk supplier lookup

### Excel Generation
- Uses `openpyxl` library
- Generates in-memory workbook (BytesIO)
- Streams response to avoid memory issues with large exports
- Applies Excel formatting (colors, borders, fonts)
