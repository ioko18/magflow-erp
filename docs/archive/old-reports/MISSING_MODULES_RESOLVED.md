# Missing Modules Resolution

## Issue
The following modules were missing at the expected import paths:
- `app.services.rbac_service`
- `app.services.payment_service`
- `app.services.emag_product_publishing_service`
- `app.services.sms_service`
- `app.services.redis_cache`

## Root Cause
These services existed in subdirectories but were being imported from the root `app.services` level:
- `rbac_service` → Located in `app.services.security.rbac_service`
- `payment_service` → Located in `app.services.orders.payment_service`
- `emag_product_publishing_service` → Located in `app.services.emag.emag_product_publishing_service`
- `sms_service` → Located in `app.services.communication.sms_service`
- `redis_cache` → Located in `app.services.infrastructure.redis_cache`

## Solution
Created re-export stub files at the root service level to maintain backward compatibility:

### Created Files:
1. **`/app/services/rbac_service.py`**
   - Re-exports from `app.services.security.rbac_service`
   - Exports: `RBACService`, `Permission`, `Role`, `check_permission`

2. **`/app/services/payment_service.py`**
   - Re-exports from `app.services.orders.payment_service`
   - Exports: `PaymentService`, `PaymentStatus`, `PaymentMethod`, `PaymentGatewayType`, etc.

3. **`/app/services/emag_product_publishing_service.py`**
   - Re-exports from `app.services.emag.emag_product_publishing_service`
   - Exports: `EmagProductPublishingService`

4. **`/app/services/sms_service.py`**
   - Re-exports from `app.services.communication.sms_service`
   - Exports: `SMSService`, `SMSStatus`, `SMSProvider`, `NotificationType`, etc.

5. **`/app/services/redis_cache.py`**
   - Re-exports from `app.services.infrastructure.redis_cache`
   - Exports: `RedisCache`, `cache`, `cached`, `cache_key_builder`, `setup_cache`

## Verification
All imports have been tested and verified to work correctly:
```python
from app.services.rbac_service import RBACService
from app.services.payment_service import PaymentService
from app.services.emag_product_publishing_service import EmagProductPublishingService
from app.services.sms_service import SMSService
from app.services.redis_cache import cache
```

## Benefits
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing imports
- ✅ No need to refactor existing code that uses these imports
- ✅ Clear re-export pattern for future reference
- ✅ All services remain in their logical subdirectories
