# Low Stock Export - Image Feature Implementation

## Date: 2025-10-11

## Summary
Added product image functionality to the Low Stock Products Excel export feature.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Columns Added
- **图片** (Image) - First column, displays product image thumbnail
- **URL Imagine Produs** (Product Image URL) - Last column, shows the image URL

### 2. Column Structure
The Excel export now has 7 columns (previously 5):

| Column | Header | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| A | 图片 | Product image thumbnail (80x80px) |
| B | 名称 | Chinese product name |
| C | 数量 | Quantity to reorder |
| D | 零售价 | Unit price (CNY) |
| E | 金额 | Total amount |
| F | 商品链接 | Supplier product link |
| G | URL Imagine Produs | Product image URL |

### 3. Technical Implementation

#### Dependencies Added
- **Pillow** (>=10.0.0) - For image processing
- **requests** (>=2.31.0) - For downloading images from URLs

#### Image Processing Features
- Downloads product images from URLs
- Resizes images to 80x80 pixels (thumbnail)
- Converts to PNG format for Excel compatibility
- Sets row height to 60 pixels to accommodate images
- Graceful error handling - continues export if image fails

#### Code Changes
**File**: `/app/api/v1/endpoints/inventory/low_stock_suppliers.py`

1. Added imports:
   ```python
   import requests
   from PIL import Image
   from openpyxl.drawing.image import Image as ExcelImage
   ```

2. Updated header merge cells from `A1:E1` to `A1:G1`

3. Added image insertion logic:
   - Downloads image from `product.image_url`
   - Resizes using PIL
   - Inserts into Excel using `openpyxl.drawing.image`
   - Sets row height for proper display

4. Updated column widths:
   - Column A (Image): 12
   - Column B (Name): 60
   - Column C (Quantity): 9
   - Column D (Price): 9
   - Column E (Amount): 9
   - Column F (Link): 45
   - Column G (Image URL): 50

5. Updated total cell position from column 4 to column 5

### 4. Error Handling
- If image download fails (timeout, invalid URL, etc.), the export continues without the image
- 5-second timeout for image downloads to prevent hanging
- Try-except block catches all exceptions during image processing

### 5. Installation
To use this feature, install the new dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually:
```bash
pip install Pillow>=10.0.0 requests>=2.31.0
```

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with products that have valid image URLs
2. Test with products that have invalid/missing image URLs
3. Test with large exports (100+ products)
4. Verify image quality and sizing in Excel
5. Test with different image formats (JPG, PNG, WebP)

## Notes
- Images are downloaded synchronously during export, which may slow down large exports
- Consider implementing image caching for better performance in future iterations
- Row height is set to 60 pixels to properly display 80x80 images
